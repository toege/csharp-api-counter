//Extension #1
//TODO:  1. Write a controller method that increments the Value property of a counter of any given Id.
//e.g.  with an Id=1  the Books counter Value should be increased from 5 to 6
//return the counter you have increased

//Extension #2
//TODO: 2. Write a controller method that decrements the Value property of a counter of any given Id.
//e.g.  with an Id=1  the Books counter Value should be decreased from 5 to 4
//return the counter you have decreased

//Super Optional Extension #1 - Refactor the code!
// - move the EndPoints into their own class and ensure they are mapped correctly
// - add a repository layer: interface & concrete class, inject this into the endpoint using the builder.Service
